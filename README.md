## 📂 Project Overview

**DHCN** (Discrete Holographic Causal Network) is a unified theoretical framework based on **Computational Ontology**. This project proposes that physical reality is not founded on a continuous geometric spacetime, but on a **bandwidth-limited discrete information processing network**.

This repository contains a Python-based physics engine designed to verify how macroscopic physical phenomena naturally emerge from underlying **information processing rules**, without the need for *ad hoc* hypotheses like Dark Matter or Dark Energy.

**Key Emergent Phenomena:**
1.  **Special Relativity**: Time dilation arising from bandwidth allocation.
2.  **Inertia**: Computational cost of network reconfiguration.
3.  **Dark Matter**: Entropic gravity corrections from long-range entanglement.
4.  **Dark Energy**: Cosmic acceleration driven by network node proliferation.
5.  **Spacetime Emergence**: Geometric crystallization from random quantum foam.

## 🏗️ Core Axioms

The simulation is built upon three fundamental DHCN axioms:

1.  **Network Ontology**: The universe is a dynamic graph $G(V,E)$ of Qubits. Space is the emergence of entanglement relationships; Time is the sequential update count of local nodes.
2.  **Bandwidth Conservation**: Every node has a maximum processing frequency $\Omega_{max}$ (Planck Frequency). There is a zero-sum trade-off between "internal refresh rate" ($f_\tau$) and "spatial translation rate" ($f_x$).
    * $$f_\tau^2 + f_x^2 = \Omega_{max}^2$$
3.  **Computational Cost**: Inertia is the Landauer cost of rewriting connections. Gravity is the statistical tendency of the network to maximize entanglement entropy.

## 🛠️ Requirements

The simulations are built using standard Python scientific stacks.

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib networkx scipy
```

## 🚀 Experiments & Verification

This repository includes 6 core scripts verifying the "Minimum Viable Universe" (MVU).

### 1. Relativity & Time Dilation
* **File**: `01_relativity_kinematics.py`
* **Theory**: Time slows down because high-speed motion consumes the bandwidth required for state refreshing.
* **Result**: At $v=0.8c$, the internal clock rate is exactly **0.6000** ($\gamma$ factor).

### 2. The Origin of Inertia
* **File**: `02_inertia_limit.py`
* **Theory**: As $v \to c$, the marginal computational cost of rewriting links approaches infinity.
* **Result**: Under constant thrust, acceleration decays to zero, naturally forming a **light-speed barrier** without hard-coding it.

### 3. Galaxy Rotation (Dark Matter)
* **File**: `03_galaxy_rotation.py`
* **Theory**: Gravity includes an entropic correction term ($\alpha \ln r$) due to long-range network entanglement.
* **Result**: Reproduces **Flat Rotation Curves** matching astronomical observations without introducing invisible mass (Dark Matter).

### 4. Quantum Collapse (Double Slit)
* **File**: `04_quantum_path_integral.py`
* **Theory**: "Wave" is parallel complex pathfinding; "Particle" is serial probabilistic refresh. Collapse is a mode switch.
* **Result**: The simulation yields a constructive/observed intensity ratio of **2.00**, confirming the mathematical transition from amplitude summation to probability summation.

### 5. Cosmic Jerk (Dark Energy)
* **File**: `05_cosmic_expansion.py`
* **Theory**: Dark Energy is the natural **proliferation** of network nodes. Expansion force scales with network size ($\dot{N} \propto N$).
* **Result**: Reproduces the **Cosmic Jerk**—the transition from early gravitational deceleration to late-stage exponential acceleration.

### 6. Emergence of Spacetime
* **File**: `06_spacetime_crystal.py`
* **Theory**: Spacetime is a low-energy geometric crystal that emerges from a high-dimensional random graph (Quantum Foam) via the interplay of Gravity (Ricci flow) and Dark Energy (Link cutting).
* **Result**: A random network spontaneously evolves into a structured geometry with high clustering coefficients.
